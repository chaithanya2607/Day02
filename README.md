1) QUESTION Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
ANSWER   
-- HTTP is a set  of rules or protocol which allows users to exchange website informations. The main difference between them is that HTTP2 is way more faster than HTTP1 , it takes less than half the time that HTTP1 takes in processing.
The security that HTTP2 provides is more as it is always encrypted and thus more secure than HTTP1.
Also  HTTP2 , being multiplexed it can take more than one request paralelly than the single tcp transfer in HTTP1 making it consume less time.
The main difference is that HTTP2 uses binary protocol which uses less bandwidth and reduces errors and are easily parsed than the textual protocols of HTTP1.
The HTTP2 servers push likely usable resources into cache and produces faster responses without the need of extra request cycles.


2) QUESTION Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
ANSWER
--Javascript objects becomes most essential in programming as everything is an object in javascript including functions.
Objects are complex and each object contain different combination of primitive data types and reference data types.
PROPERTIES OF OBEJCTS:-
A simple variable attached to the object is called property,For example is school is an object then it will have properties like name, place, size  etc.
We can access the property of an object by 
=> a simple dot notation.
=> set or accessed by bracket notations.
=> using string value that is stored in the variable.
object.property
Object name and property name are case sensitive.
CREATING OBJECT
simply write name and propeties in curly brackets 
Ex:- myschool = { name:"Chinmaya Vidyalaya", place: "Mysore", size:"huge"}.
Constructors are implicit to javascript, however destructors are not provided in JS.
